How does CDN pricing work?
==========================

With LSN CDN you are only billed for bandwidth and not storage fees. When ordering CDN service you choose the amount of bandwidth you plan to use during the billing month. Don’t worry, if you are close to going over your bandwidth you can upgrade any time.
