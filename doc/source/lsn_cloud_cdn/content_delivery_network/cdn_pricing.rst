How does CDN pricing work?
==========================

With LSN CDN you are only billed for bandwidth and not storage fees.
When ordering CDN service you choose the amount of bandwidth you plan to use
during the billing month. Donâ€™t worry, if you are close to going over your
bandwidth you can upgrade any time.
