How to setup SSL Support
========================

**The Basics**

If your web site uses SSL anywhere on it, such as an order form, we would
highly recommend that you use this SSL-supported setup site-wide.

**The Steps**

1. Login to OnePortal’s cdn.html" target="_blank">CDN setup page.
2. Click “Modify Hostname”.
3. Turn “SSL” into the “On” position and press “Save Changes”.
4. You will be given a hostname like “yourdomain.com.r.worldssl.net” to point
   your web addresses to.
5. Make sure your hosting has a domain alias setup for the hostname provided in
   the pervious step.
