Getting started with OnePortal Rapid
====================================

After your new `cloud account
<https://www.limestonenetworks.com/cloud/servers.html>`_ is provisioned, you
will be able to log in to the `cloud control panel
<https://cloud.limestonenetworks.com/auth/login/?next=/>`_ using your OnePortal
credentials.

**Security Groups**

First, you should visit the **Access and Security** tab. This is where you will
find the configuration for **Security Groups, Key Pairs** (SSH Keys), and
**API Endpoints.**

First, let’s discuss **Security Groups**. By default, all outbound traffic from
instances is permitted, and all inbound is blocked. You will build security
groups to permit inbound services, and then assign the groups to your instances
to allow the traffic. To get started, click **+Create Security Group**.

**Management – Remote Desktop and SSH access to your instances**
Use the **+Add Rule** button to create SSH and RDP permit rules allowing
specific IP blocks or 0.0.0.0/0 (all traffic). Cloud Management Security Group

**SSH Key Pair**

Cloud images distributed by most distro builders do not allow password login
upon install. Instead, they download SSH authentication key pairs which are
downloaded upon first boot by the instance and installed as authorized remote
users. In order to gain access to your instances on the LSN One Portal Rapid
Cloud, you will need to have a key pair added to the instance when it is
created.

**Generate SSH Key**

If you already have a key pair, skip to the Add SSH Key to OnePortal Rapid
section below.

1. Navigate to the `PuTTY SSH Client <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>`_
   download page.
2. Download putty.exe and puttygen.exe
3. Open puttygen.exe and click **Generate**
4. After generating the SSH key, save the private key file to your local
   machine.
5. Copy the public key file at the top of the puttygen dialog to your
   clipboard, you will need it in the next step.

**Add SSH Key to OnePortal Rapid**

To add a key pair, navigate to **Access and Security**, and select the
**Key Pairs** tab. Then select **Import Key Pair**. Name the key pair and paste
your public key into the dialog box.

Once you have completed this step, you should see the key on your key pairs
page.

**Creating an Instance**

After creating your security group and key pair, we are ready to launch a VM!
Navigate to the **Instances** page and click  **Launch Instance**.

On the **Details** tab, name your instance, select a flavor, use instance count
1, boot from the image, and select an **Image** to boot the instance from.

Under **Access & Security**, select your **key pair** and **security group**(s)
that will permit inbound traffic to your instance. In the **Networking** tab,
select network(s) to attach the instance to. Most images only configure the
first NIC upon boot, so for testing select **Public Internet**.

Now click **Launch**, and the instance will be deployed in the cloud.

**Connect to the Created Instance**

To access the launched instance, open PuTTY and navigate to the
**Connection > SSH > Auth** settings. Set the
**“Private key file for authentication”** to the private key file you generated
earlier.

Then select the **Session** tab and enter the user@hostname for your instance.
By default, CentOS instances are configured with a **centos** user, Ubuntu uses
an **Ubuntu** user, and Fedora has a **fedora** user.

**About Volumes and Instance Boot Disks**

Think of volumes in OnePortal Rapid as hard drives that can be attached and
detached from instances without losing their data. They can be based on OS
images, instances can boot from volumes instead of the boot disk included with
the instance, or you can use volumes as bulk storage devices for user data.

For the OnePortal Rapid cloud, we have **SSD** and **HDD** volume types
available. **SSD** volumes are provisioned on flash storage, and **HDD**
volumes are provisioned on 7200 RPM drives with SSD flash-based journaling.
Both volume types include 3x data replication enabling self-healing in the
event of a disk or node failure on the cluster. Instance boot disks are
equivalent to fixed-size SSD volumes.

**Creating and Attaching Volumes**

To create a volume, select the **Volumes** page and click **+Create Volume**.
In the dialog, enter a volume name, select a volume type, and enter a disk size
for the volume you are creating.

After creating the volume, select the drop down for the volume on the dashboard
and click **Manage Attachments**. Now select your test instance and attach the
volume to it.

Confirm the volume has been attached to the instance:

To **detach** the volume, navigate back to the **Manage Attachments** page and
detach the volume. It will then be made available for deletion or attachment to
another instance.
