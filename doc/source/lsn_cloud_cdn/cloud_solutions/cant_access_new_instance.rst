Can’t access your new cloud instance?
=====================================

If you’ve just created a new cloud instance but are unable to connect to it,
there are a few quick things you can check.

1. Did you add your **Key Pair** to the instance before creating it?
2. Did you add a **Security Group** to the instance that allows for SSH/RDP
   connections?
3. When configuring the network of the instance did you add your Public Network
   as **NIC1**?
4. If using Windows, have you retrieved the **Windows Admin password**?


If you’re still having issues connecting please create a Support ticket and
we’ll be more than happy to assist.
