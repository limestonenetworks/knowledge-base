==========================================
Is there a firewall for the cloud servers?
==========================================

Cloud servers work exactly like dedicated servers when it comes to security.
You may use the firewall within the operating system to apply protection.
However additionally you may use the firewall settings in OnePortal to protect
your cloud server at the hypervisor level– meaning the traffic doesn’t make
it into your cloud server.
