Cloud Key Pairs
===============

Key pairs are necessary for Cloud VM access.
Key pairs can be created or imported in the **“Access and Security”** tab in
your Cloud control panel.

Creating a key pair in the control panel will allow you to download a private
key file which you can import into your ssh application or service.
You may also import a keypair using the public key that you have generated
elsewhere.

- Key pair name Enter the key pair name of your choosing.
- Public key Paste your previously generated public key here.

Once a keypair has been added you may use it when creating a new VM.
