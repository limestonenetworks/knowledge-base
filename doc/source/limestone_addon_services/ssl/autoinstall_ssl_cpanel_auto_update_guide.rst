AutoInstall SSL (cPanel) Auto Update Guide
==========================================

**To use the Auto Update function with our AutoInstall SSL™ plugin, first you
need to setup a cron job using the Command prompt (we recommended running the
cronjob weekly).**

**How do I Add/Edit the Crontab?**

- Login to server using Putty

To add or update the cronjob in the crontab, use the below command. It will
open the crontab file in editor where the cronjob can be added/updated.
::

  crontab –e
