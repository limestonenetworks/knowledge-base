Acquire an AutoInstall SSL voucher
==================================

Limestone Networks uses the AutoInstall SSL platform to provide our partners
all SSL certificates. Along instant RapidSSL certificates you can now choose
from VeriSign® (Symantec™), GeoTrust®, Thawte, RapidSSL, Comodo and TrustWave
directly from us and get better pricing than if you were buying from the
vendor. Please review the details below to acquire your SSL certificate.
You can also install your certificates manually, if desired.

Before getting started, you will need to make sure you have the AutoInstall
SSL plugin loaded on your cPanel/WHM or Plesk installation. Details on how to
