What is rDNS?
=============

rDNS is **Reverse** DNS.

rDNS operates in the exact opposite direction of DNS, it converts IP addresses
into domains.

**What do we need rDNS for?**

One great use of rDNS is for e-mail servers. Example:

- Your e-mail server ``mail.yourdomain.com`` contacts ``mydomain.com’s``
  **mail server**.
- ``mydomain.com`` resolves ``mail.yourdomain.com`` into **172.22.0.1**, in
  order to send information back to the server.
- However, ``mydomain.com`` has security measures.. It wants to make sure
  **172.22.0.1** really is mail.yourdomain.com, so it performs a rDNS lookup.
- **172.22.0.1** turns out to resolve to ``mail.yourdomain.com``, so it sends
  it’s data.

**How do I modify rDNS records for my IP(s)?**


The control panel enables the customer to modify rDNS entries directly to their
IP address(s), via http://one.limestonenetworks.com/dns/reversedns.html.
