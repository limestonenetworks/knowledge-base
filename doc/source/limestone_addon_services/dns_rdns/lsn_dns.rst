How do I use Limestone’s DNS service?
=====================================

We provide 3 managed redundant name-servers for your convenience, If you don’t
want the trouble of creating your own nameservers (eg: ns1.MYDOMAIN.com), you
can use the DNS Panel located under the Control Panel
https://rw.limestonenetworks.com/dns/


**Nameservers**

Before editing domain DNS information under the control panel, you must change
your domain registrar’s name-servers for your domain to:

- ``ns1.limestonenetworks.com``
- ``ns2.limestonenetworks.com``

We also provide whitelisted DNS services using the following nameservers:

- ``ns1.dallas-idc.com``
- ``ns2.dallas-idc.com``

After setting these as your nameservers under your domain registrar, please
allow between 24 – 48 hours for the name-server records to fully propagate.

Now you can continue modifying domain records via the Control Panel.

Changes made under the control panel are **not immediate**, please allow up to
30 minutes for the records to update. However, some changes may be active after
as little as 5 minutes.

**Summary**

- Set domain registrar’s name-server records to Limestone’s nameservers.
- Wait 24 – 48 hours for the changes to take place.
- Modify domain information under the Control Panel.
- Allow time for changes to take effect.
