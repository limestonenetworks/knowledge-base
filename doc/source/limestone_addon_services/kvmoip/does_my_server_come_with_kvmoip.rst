Does my server come with KVMoIP?
================================

**It’s very possible.**

All of Limestone’s Intel Xeon servers come with integrated IPMI. This IPMI interface gives you access to great features including KVMoIP. If you don’t know how to connect to your IPMI interface, open a Support ticket and we’ll gladly point you in the right direction.

If your server is not an Intel Xeon server, we offer KVMoIP based on how long you’d like it.
