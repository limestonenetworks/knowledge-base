Do you offer DDoS Protection?
=============================

We offer two levels of network attack protection.

**Basic Protection, Free**

– Basic protection using a defined set of filtering rules. If mitigation is
possible using the predefined rules, it can take up to 5 minutes for traffic
to return to normal. If the automatic detection was unable to automatically add
the filter, we can certainly analyze your traffic and add the filter to
which-ever IP needs it.

**Enterprise Protection, $50/month per IP**

– This protection is always-on and detects attacks within seconds. It protects
up to 20Gbps and 12 million packets per second. It not only filters attacks it
knows about, but also has the capability of automatically learning new attack
methods and block them real-time.
