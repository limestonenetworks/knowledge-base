Do you offer VMware ESXi?
=========================

Yes!


We have recently added VMWare ESXi as a supported operating system. We also
support automated reloads of this operating system from within our control
panel.


You will need to
`register <https://www.vmware.com/try-vmware.html?PID=8346037&PubCID=4917229>`_
on VMWareâ€™s website in order to retrieve a license key. Once you have
received your license key you can follow this `guide
<https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2014295?sliceId=1&dialogID=499852417&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&stateId=1+0+499856347#.VMuPCj-oGTg.link>`_
on entering it. This is done from within the vSphere client under the Home >
Inventory Configuration Tab.


**If you do not obtain a license key your VMWare ESXi evaluation period will
expire and your installation may cease to function.**
