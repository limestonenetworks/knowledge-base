Configuring Softaculous with WHMCS to Auto Install Client Websites
==================================================================

This guide will help you integrate your Softaculous installation with WHMCS to
automate your web hosting business. This can only be `configured with WHM
servers
<http://limestonenetworks-knowledge-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limestone_addon_services/software/install_softaculous_whm.html>`_
and DirectAdmin servers currently.

**Install the Hook in WHMCS**

1. Download the Softaculous Auto Installation Hook. It is available from
   `WHMCS Community Addons <https://www.softaculous.com/docs/File:Autoinstall.zip>`_
2. Extract the file ``softaculous.php`` and upload it to
   ``/full_path_to/whmcs/includes/hooks/``
3. Optionally, upload the file ``softaculous_debug.php`` to
   ``/full_path_to/whmcs/includes/hooks/``
4. Remove the file ``softaculous_debug.php`` from the hooks directory after
   testing

Note: ``The softaculous_extra.php`` file adds Auto Installation capabilities
for custom scripts. Otherwise, you do not need to upload this file.

**Activating the Hook with Your Hosting Plans**

**Here is a list of popular scripts, which are comma-separated for your
convenience:**

``None, WordPress, b2evolution, StatusNet, Drupal, Mambo, phpBB, SMF, AEF,``
``Coppermine, Gallery, Jcow, OpenClassifieds, openX, WebCalendar, Shadows

**Setup when the Module Runs**

The Hook will run to auto install the scripts only when an account is being
created. To modify when this takes place, go to Setup -> Products/Services ->
Products/Services and choose the hosting plan for automation.


Select your desired settings and hit the ``“Save Changes”`` button.

**Testing the Module**

Initiate an order from a Dummy Account. Ensure that the Admin Name and Admin
Pass are setup and that a script is selected.

Then click on the ``“Create”`` button to create the order.

You should see a box on the page that reads: ``“Are you sure you want to run
the create function?”``

Confirm this action by clicking the ``“Yes”`` button.

If the module was successful, you will see the message ``“Script Installed
successfully”``

If the hook was unsuccessful, you will see ``“Installation not completed”``
followed by the error given

When you are finished testing the module, remove the ``softaculous_debug.php``
file from your WHMCS installation
