How to whitelist an IP for WHMCS API.
=====================================

You may find that you need to add an IP address to the WHMCS whitelist in
order to connect certain applications. Here is a guide:

1. Login to your WHMSC
2. Go to Setup -> General Settings
3. Click on the Security tab
4. Find the “API IP Access Restriction” box
5. Click the “Add IP” button and put in the IP address

  - For example if you are connecting OnePortal to use the plugin on the
    Dashboard, you would add the IP address 64.31.0.178.

6. Press Save Changes when finished.
