How to whitelist an IP for WHMCS API.
=====================================

Any time you are connecting another application to WHMCS via their API, you have to add the IP address of the application WHMCS and allow access. Here’s how:

1. Login to your WHMSC
2. Go to Setup -> General Settings
3. Click on the Security tab
4. Find the “API IP Access Restriction” box
5. Click the “Add IP” button and put in the IP address
  
  - For example if you are connecting OnePortal to use the plugin on the Dashboard, you 
    would add the IP address 64.31.0.178.

6. Press Save Changes when finished.
