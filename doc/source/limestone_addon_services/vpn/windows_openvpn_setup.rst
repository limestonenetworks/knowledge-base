VPN Install On Windows 8.1
==========================

This howto will assist you with installing OpenVPN to access services on the
Limestone Private Network

For example, services available on the private network include: The `private
interfaces <http://limestonenetworks-knowledge-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limestone_addon_services/vpn/limestone_private_tunnel.html>`_
on your servers,
`Shared NAS Drives <http://limestonenetworks-knowledge-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limestone_addon_services/nas/setup_nas_acc.html>`_,
and
`IPMI devices <http://limestonenetworks-knowledge-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limestone_addon_services/kvmoip/access_server_ipmi.html>`_
for your servers.

1. Download and launch the OpenVPN installer for your OS from `OpenVPN’s
   website <https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html>`_.

4. At this point OpenVPN is installed and **you should REBOOT before
continuing the installation process**. The reboot is necessary because we
typically do not see the tunnel network interface registered until a reboot
occurs.

5. Download the Limestone Private Network OpenVPN configuration files from your
`OnePortal account’s VPN page
<https://one.limestonenetworks.com/servers/vpn.html>`_.

We recommend using the UDP profile for the best performance. A TCP profile is
also provided in case you are on a restrictive, firewalled network that will
not permit the UDP profile. The TCP profile is more reliable in these cases
however it will not be as fast as the UDP tunnel.

11. Use your OnePortal credentials to log in to the VPN.
