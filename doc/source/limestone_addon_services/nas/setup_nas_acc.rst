How do I set up my NAS account?
===============================

Setting up access to your NAS account is pretty simple. All of the information
and steps can be found in OnePortal.

Before you start, make sure that Samba is installed in Linux if you are using a
Linux operating system.

Then, visit `OnePortalâ€™s Shared NAS
<https://one.limestonenetworks.com/servers/sharednas.html>`_ page and click
the (?) icon next to the share you would like to mount. Further instructions
are provided there.


**Only Accessible Internally**

The NAS is only accessible over the private network. If you wish to store files
on it remotely, you would need to setup FTP (or some other file transfer
server) and map it to the mount point of the NAS on your server. You would then
connect to your server to access it.
