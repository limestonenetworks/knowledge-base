What can I use the NAS for?
===========================

NAS (Network Attached Storage) can be used to store files for:

- Incremental Backups
- Additional Storage
- Transfer / sync files between servers

Limestone’s NAS systems are on `Limestone’s Private Tunnel <http://limestonenetworks-knowledge-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limestone_addon_services/vpn/limestone_private_tunnel.html>`_ which means you get unmetered free transfer between your NAS space and your servers.
