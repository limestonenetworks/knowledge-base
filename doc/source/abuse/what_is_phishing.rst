What is Phishing?
=================

Phishing is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire
sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by
masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. In this
case we are speaking of Website forgery.

**What do I need to do?**

If you receive an abuse notice that a phishing site is detected on your server,
action is required on your part.

In the ticket you will find the domain and IP address that the phishing website
is located on. We ask that you suspend or remove the website immediately and
reply back to the ticket letting us know the action taken.
