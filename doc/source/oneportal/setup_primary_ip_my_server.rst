How do I set Primary IP of my server?
=====================================

When you have multiple blocks, its hard for our Support Techs to determine
which IP is your primary. Additionally it can become confusing for you
everywhere we display your server’s IP address if it is not correctly set to
your primary IP address.

You may now define your primary IP address by doing the following:

1. Login to our control panel
2. Go to the Servers tab
3. Click Edit Name/IP next to the server you’d like to change the Primary IP on
4. Choose your new Primary IP at the bottom of the page
5. Press the Update Primary IP button at the bottom
