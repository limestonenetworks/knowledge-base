How can I restart my server remotely?
=====================================

There are many ways to restart your server remotely without having to contact
our Support team.

**If you have access to your server…**

**Restart your server through SSH (Linux)**

Connect to your server through SSH and run either of these commands:

- shutdown -r now
- reboot
- init 6

**Restart your server through RDP (Windows)**

After connecting to your Windows server using Remote Desktop, use the start
button to initiate a restart.

**If you cannot access your server…**
**Use the IPMI Interface**

Most of our dedicated servers come with a remote management interface. From
OnePortal, simply click the black console icon next to your server’s name. You
can then login using your OnePortal login.

**Restart through OnePortal**

As a last resort, you can restart your server through OnePortal by clicking on
your server’s name and clicking the ``Power`` button.
