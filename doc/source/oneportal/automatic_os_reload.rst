<https://www.limestonenetworks.com/dedicated-servers/bare-metal.html>`_ at any
time through your control panel. This service is absolutely free and requires
little to no tech interaction.

don’t, your server will automatically reinstall the control panel previously
installed.

2. In the details area click on the OS Reload tab
3. On the “Operating System Reload” page click Reload on the right hand side
4. Use the provided password or enter and confirm your own
5. Check the box at the bottom of the form declaring you would like all data
   erased and the OS reinstalled
6. Click Start Reload

**NOTE: If Auto OS Reload is unavailable then the column will read “Contact
Support” and provide you with a link to instantly open a ticket.**
