Can I set rDNS through the API?
===============================

Yes, you may. Our API supports a method called ``setreverse`` which allows you to set your Reverse DNS per IP Address. See the `API documentation <http://limestonenetworks-knowledge-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oneportal/api_usage_and_methods.html>`_ for more information.
